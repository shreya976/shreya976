I am a pre-doctoral fellow at IIM Bangalore in the field of decision science, under the mentorship of [Dr. Saudeep Deb](https://soudeepd.github.io/). Here, I have worked on developing novel methodologies for predicting disease outbreaks and evaluating them using experimental and simulation approaches. Currently, I am focused on quantile autoregression and its efficiency in predicting higher values in time series data. 


I am a dedicated researcher with a post-graduate degree in Statistics and a Masterâ€™s in Population Studies. With a profound interest in public health research. With a master's in population studies from the International Institute for Population Sciences in Mumbai, my academic journey has been enriched with a comprehensive MSc in Statistics from Sardar Patel University, Anand, Gujarat, and a BSc in Statistics from Savitribai Phule Pune University, Maharashtra.

## Professional Journey

In my recent role as a Statistician and Jr Data Manager at Johns Hopkins India Private Limited, Pune, I played a pivotal role in supervising data management staff, developing clinical risk prediction methods, and contributing to the statistical analysis plans for complex public health and clinical research projects.


I have worked on many freelance projects, showcasing my proficiency in designing surveys, analyzing clinical data, and leveraging statistical methodologies.
